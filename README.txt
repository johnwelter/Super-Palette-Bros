click a palette square from the game, then from the main palette to change it's color. 

some squares are level dependant, meaning that the colors are different across the three main types of level (underwater, overworld, underworld, castle). selecting a level type from the drop down menu will change the visible palette accordingly. 

some are level independant, in that they are constatnt throughout the game. 

dependent colors:

main background colors
first 3 BG slots
last 3 sprite slots
last two ? block / coin colors

independent colors:

mario colors
luigi colors
fire mario/luigi colors
bowser
? block/ coin animation colors

you can load a ROM of SMB, edit it's palette, and inject back into the ROM, or another ROM. 
you can export and open the palettes you make as XMLs if your making one you'd like to pass around.
